# WSM (Web Sandbox Mode)
### by ME!! HOORAY!!!!!

A silly bookmarklet that lets you move and resize literally WHATEVER THE HELL YOU WANT on most webpages.  
I wanted to make this because i was bored. Very proud :D

## features, i guess
WSM basically turns any webpage into a sandbox (I'm sure you couldn't have guessed by teh name)!! yippee! 
You can:
- Drag stuff 
- Resize stuff (Hold alt on pc and pinch on mobile)
- Kill all the fun by deactivating it
- Deactivating it restores everything's positions  

This is *NOT* meant to be useful. It is meant for the FUNNIES!!!!! YAY
